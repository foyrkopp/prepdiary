<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>So, our current DM has announced that, for the foreseeable future,
they won’t have time to prep &amp; run the campaign we’d started. It
sucks, but that’s life for you.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I’d already mentioned that, in such an event, I’d be
willing to jump in with a simple homebrew campaign. So now I’ve got to
put my money where my mouth is.</p>
<p>First session is in less than a week and, up to now, I’ve got nothing
but a few idle musings.</p>
<p>Crap.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="situation-review" class="section level1">
<h1>Situation Review</h1>
<p>A few words about the peculiarities of my table:</p>
<ul>
<li>This’ll be an in-person game at a real table, not online</li>
<li>We’ve played a group of PCs to lvl 6 through official modules and
multiple players have voiced strong preferences to keep those PCs.</li>
<li>We’ve played together for years, although not DnD.
<ul>
<li>I know decently well what each player likes to get out of a
game</li>
<li>I know their playstyle and won’t have to worry about potential
weird/toxic behaviors random new players rarely but occasionally
bring</li>
<li>We recently had a discussion about what styles of campaigns they
like, so I know what to aim for so that, even if not everyone gets their
personal top preference, it’s something they’ll all get some enjoyment
out of.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If those things are not clear without any doubt for your
group, <em>talk about them</em> before doing anything else.</strong></p>

</div>
<div id="nailing-down-a-campaign-setting" class="section level1">
<h1>Nailing down a campaign setting</h1>
<p>Creativity is a cat.</p>
<p>If you call it by name, stare at it and expect it to Come Here Right
Now, it’ll ruffle it’s nose at you and then slink away into some shadow
dimension.</p>
<p>But if you ignore it for a while and do something
unrelated-yet-interesting, it’ll suddenly - thump - land on your
shoulder, curiously examining your doings, before walking all over your
keyboard while shoving <del>it’s butt</del> The Eye of Sauron into your
face.</p>
<p>So I force myself to give it a day or two before actually sitting
down and <em>doing</em> anything. Just juggling idle thoughts whenever
I’m not too occupied with normal life stuff.</p>
<p>Anything below, until I explicitly state otherwise, was just stuff I
found myself thinking about while doing household chores, driving,
walking, not paying attention in meetings etc.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that, while, below, I break those thoughts
down in neatly, topic-focused section, <em>coming up</em> with that
stuff was a disjointed, all-over-the-place process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="step-1---what-do-we-actually-need" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 1 - What do we actually need?</h2>
<p>Since I want to minimize prep, I’d like to go with some sort of open
world campaign, where the party themselves will set their goals more
often than not.</p>
<p>This means they won’t be in permanent employment of a single faction
(which can also be a fun campaign, but I did that recently), but
independent. And <em>this</em> means that, both to the heroes and to the
people who might request their aid, just calling the cops to solve the
problem should generally not be a feasible option.</p>
<p>In my mind, there’s generally two ways to go about this - either the
centralized power is antagonistic and you don’t <em>want</em> to involve
them (your classic “corrupt state” scenario - <em>Shadowrun</em> and
<em>Blades in the Dark</em> are based around this trope), or the
centralized power is just not readily available (i.e. a frontier setting
or one ravaged by some large scale disaster, war, etc.)</p>
<p>Like mentioned, I’d already idly mused about the setting a bit before
and know which book I want to adapt (see below) - and this particular
one clearly lends itself to the latter approach.</p>
<p>We’ll <em>also</em> want a central conflict, some default source of
tension. It’ll not only lend our setting a distinct identity, but also
serve as a crystallization seed for all kinds of narrative details,
plots, NPC motivations etc.</p>
<p><strong>Prep Time for this session</strong>: None, this is stuff I
already knew.</p>
<p><strong>Total Prep Time for next session:</strong> None / 2 days of
“mulling it over a bit”</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="step-2---choosing-a-template-to-steal-from"
class="section level2">
<h2>Step 2 - Choosing a template to steal from</h2>
<p>The above isn’t exactly big news. Countless authors have worked along
those lines. Let’s steal from them.</p>
<p>In this particular case, I had already considered turning Robert
Jackson Benett’s <em>City of Stairs</em> into a campaign setting
somehow. (It’s a great book, I recommend to read it.)</p>
<p>So now it’s time to actually do that, with the least amount of work
possible.</p>
<p>A few mangled words concerning what I remember and/or care about from
the book(s) in terms of setting (sorry to the author):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a theocracy that’s ruled not by the Clergy, but by their gods
themselves. Physically manifest, very powerful gods, freely granting
miracles, divine artifacts and powers to their flock, leading them in
times of war, etc.</p>
<p>Naturally, humans being humans, said theocracy wound up becoming an
empire that brutally conquered, subjugated and exploited the other
nations of the continent, who did not have this kind of divine
backing.</p>
<p>This was the status quo throughout virtually all of known history -
until one of those subjugated people invented a weapon that can slay
gods.</p>
<p>One extremely ruthless liberation war and lots of fallen deities
later, the former vassal states are flourishing, while the former empire
is a failed state under foreign occupation by the very people they once
subjugated themselves.</p>
<p>Even beyond the devastations and population losses by war, virtually
all of their infrastructure, once powered by miracles, has broken down.
Divine artifacts have stopped working, been confiscated or became,
bereft of all safeguards, too hazardous to utilize.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There were more details on my mind, but I’ll bring them up when
they’re relevant - for now, this should suffice.</p>
<p>The idea is that most of the campaign will take place in the occupied
territories of the fallen empire, let’s call them the Broken Lands for
now. Lots of strife and limited efficacy of government means there’ll be
lots of space for individual heroism, evil warlords rising to power,
magical artifacts waiting to be found and political powder kegs to be
lit, defused or leveraged.</p>
<p><strong>Prep Time for this section:</strong> None, I’ve already read
the book.</p>

</div>
<div id="step-3---how-do-the-pcs-fit-into-all-of-this"
class="section level2">
<h2>Step 3 - How do the PCs fit into all of this?</h2>
<p>So now we have an environment that vaguely looks like a clichéd,
blurred version of Afghanistan 2015.</p>
<p>We also have a rough idea of what we imagine our party doing -
exploring secrets, solving local problems, getting involved in political
tensions etc.</p>
<p>How do we enable them to do that? In my mind, the above will involve
dealing with at least some of the local powers on a civilized and
vaguely eye-to-eye level. Being hired, being invited to certain events,
negotiating, stuff like that - even when the party starts out and has
very little reputation.</p>
<p><strong>Why would the mayor of Troubleville pay an advance to a bunch
of strangers with no credentials or reputation and hope that they’ll
actually go and take care of that banditry problem?</strong></p>
<p>In a world where quest boards are commonplace, the hiring of aspiring
heroes is a well established practice. This, however, is a setting where
most heavily armed strangers are assumed to be just as likely to rob you
as to help you - or, at the very, least, take the advance you’re paying
them and vanish.</p>
<p>(To many tables, this might seem like an irrelevant problem, but I
know from experience that my players care about such small
implausibilities - and this is a problem that seems fixable.)</p>
<p>In short, I want a veneer of legitimacy for our party. Something
that’d tell our hypothetical mayor immediately that they can expect
those budget Avengers to behave somewhat civilized, maybe even
professional. And I don’t want to hinge said legitimacy on a single PC
who might have a respected background.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a century old real-life solution to this
problem: A guild.</p>
<p>I don’t want to ordain from the bat that the PCs are a straight-out
mercenary group (because we already did that in another campaign). And I
don’t like the concept of an “adventurers guild” as seen in some tropes,
because I don’t think “adventurer” is something most people in the
setting would consider an actual profession. But maybe we can adapt
those concepts.</p>
<p>All I <em>really</em> need is the public knowledge that their guild
will vouch for these people behaving in a somewhat civilized fashion and
honouring their contracts (or else the guild itself will come after
them). It smells a bit “mercenary”, but I imagine it covering all sorts
of specialist-for-hire, not just military ones.</p>
<p>Why would our mayor trust that guild? Let’s make it an old, respected
concept.</p>
<p>Maybe the guild has existed, in one form or another, for centuries.
It has fallen a bit by the wayside during the reign of the Empire
(because the Empire had it’s own means of enforcing civilized behaviour,
adherence to contracts etc.). But the idea survived, in tales and maybe
some derived traditions (i.e. the way certain oaths are sworn).</p>
<p>And now, in a time when more immediate centralized authority is
lacking, the guild has been revived and is experiencing sort of a
renaissance.</p>
<p>The baseline concept is that it’s less strictly organized as a
regular guild, and more focused on an oath sworn on a code of conduct.
Swear to uphold said code and you get to wear the badge, which people
will recognize and respect. Learn of someone with the badge breaking the
code and you’ll have to bring them to justice. Break the code yourself
and the guild will send your peers after you.</p>
<p>Until we come up with a better name, we’ll just call it <em>The
Guild</em>.</p>

class="section level2">
<h2>Step 4 - Adapting the setting for a DnD campaign</h2>
<div id="technology" class="section level3">
<h3>Technology</h3>
<p>In the books, the technology level is somewhere in the early 20th
century, which is too much a headache for me in DnD terms.</p>
<p>17th century sounds doable - saying that the victorious, “modern”
states are routinely using flintlock weapons in their militaries, while
those are rare and expensive in the Broken Lands, is a good baseline to
give a “feel” to the state of technology.</p>
</div>
<div id="exploration" class="section level3">
<h3>Exploration</h3>
<p>While thinking about things, I stumble across a snag: I want my party
to be able to explore places that are not yet (widely) known. But the
Broken Lands are a former empire that was heavily populated for
centuries - wouldn’t virtually all of the immediately exploring long be
done? There should be detailed imperial maps, right?</p>
<p>So… let’s say that the fall of the gods changed things somehow. Maps
are no longer accurate. People remember things that aren’t true. Either
reality or recorded information has been altered, I don’t need to decide
which one yet, either way sounds cool.</p>
</div>
<div id="character-generation-options" class="section level3">
<h3>Character Generation Options</h3>
<p>Besides the virtual superpowers granted by the now extinct(?) deities
of the empire, I imagine most cultures having access to “regular” divine
magics, so we won’t do something drastic like banning Clerics.</p>
<p>Concerning races, I’m a big fan of low-fantasy settings (and imagine
this one as such), where I have trouble imagining most of the more
exotic races fitting in.</p>
<p>However, I know that one of my players will definitely want to carry
over a Tiefling they’re currently playing, so we’ll need an idea of how
those fit in.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the classic fits well here: A <del>Wizard</del> Cleric
did it. Some of the imperial Clerics tried to “improve” people according
to some divine ideal by creating new subraces. God &amp; Cleric are
gone, the races still exist. Done.</p>

<div id="step-5---writing-a-primer" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 5 - Writing a Primer</h2>
<p><em>Now</em> it is time to actually sit down and do some actual
work.</p>
<p>In particular, my players need an elevator pitch for the campaign so
that they can either Yay or Nay it and think about how either their
existing characters might fit in or what new character they might
play.</p>
<p>This is what I’m sending to my players:</p>
<p>(Keep in mind that this message was written way earlier than the
document you’re reading now, so some details are still in an earlier
draft at this point.</p>
<p>Also, don’t mind the occasionally wooden wording, this is a direct
translation from another language and reads better in the original.</p>
<p>Player names, where mentioned, have been changed. Duh.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Short blurb concerning the setting:</strong></p>
<p>For (very long), the dominating continental superpower was a
theocracy that owed it’s supremacy to it’s deities who not only
intervened directly and personally in the world, but also granted
fantastical supernatural powers to their followers - a high fantasy
church-state, that conquered and exploited their neighbouring countries
with superior divine magic.</p>
<p>While those vassal states did not have equivalent divine support,
they were much more technologically advanced.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, the most advanced vassal state (a fantasy version
of the terran ~17th century, including “normal” magic) found a way to
kill gods.</p>
<p>The result was a long, bloody revolution with a predictable result,
where the resentment of people subjugated for centuries broke free
completely unchecked.</p>
<p>This war ended fifteen years ago.</p>
<p>While the liberated countries are busying themselves with a cultural
and technological renaissance, rather than working through the horrors
of the war, the former territory of the collapsed theocracy is now
formally a colony administrated by a coalition of former vassal states -
and de facto a failed state, whose future is currently rather unclear:
The Broken Lands.</p>
<p><strong>Short hook for the player characters:</strong></p>
<p>The setting for most of the campaign will, obviously, be the
territory of the former theocracy.</p>
<p>The player characters are fortune-seekers (or mercenaries) that have
banded together to, for whatever personal reasons, find fame, riches,
power or knowledge in the Broken Lands.</p>
<p>Thus, you’ll often find yourself solving the “problem of the week”
(and being paid for it), but there’ll also be plenty promising
opportunities to pursue on your own initiative, if you care to do so -
and, with time, an overarching plot should emerge as well.</p>
<p>You’re not just a bunch of random Bobs with big blades and/or wands,
but members of a loose, but far-reaching guild of
fortune-seekers/mercenaries granting you a certain status: To become a
member of the guild, one has to commit to a basic code of conduct and,
in return, gets legal, organisational and, in an emergency, even
financial backing. Whoever acts against the code, will be held
accountable by the guild itself.</p>
<p>Due to the aforementioned code of conduct, and because the guild is
not directly associated with any faction of the war, members are awarded
a baseline of respect in most regions and are often hired to solve
special problems.</p>
<p>The important takeaway here is that the guild won’t dictate your
goals or define your life, but it grants you a baseline of
legitimacy.</p>
<p>(If any of you, i.e. Payne, would rather be employed by a noble house
instead of being an independent guild member, this would be fine as
well. I’d just like to avoid you being a band of heavily armed Vandals
without any advocate.)</p>
<p><strong>Short draft of mechanical boundaries, this is
negotiable:</strong></p>
<p>I’d like to downgrade the group to level three. I know, I know,
higher levels = more cool stuff - but if we want to play somewhat
consistently in this scenario, I’d prefer it if you don’t already start
out as heavyweights and level three seems like a good compromise for
this (compared to level 1).</p>
<p>If you want to continue playing your old PC, this is (obviously)
possible. If you want to keep playing them, but adapt some mechanical
details, ditto.</p>
<p>If someone would like to play a new PC:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For reasons of fairness, I’d keep the free level one feat the
established PCs already have, but it’s explicitly possible to leave this
one open and learn a fitting feat later, during actual
gameplay.</p></li>
<li><p>The rule “Customize your Origin” (from one of the newer books) is
permitted: Whoever wants, may move the ability bonuses of their race to
another ability.</p></li>
<li><p>Monk and Sorcerer will get a few bonuses to lift them to the
level of other classes. If anyone wants to play one of those, talk to
me, I wont be putting all of this in here. (Sven: For Scorch, If you
want to keep him, I’ll type this into a separate mail.)</p></li>
<li><p>The classes Twilight Cleric and Peace Cleric can’t be
chosen.</p></li>
<li><p>No multiclassing at the beginning of the game. Later, during the
campaign, it MAY be possible, but only if there’s an opportunity within
the narrative.</p></li>
<li><p>“General” civilization consists of the “human-like” races (mostly
Humans, but also Dwarves, Elfs, Halflings, Gnomes, Goliaths, Firbolgs
etc.) and the assorted goblinoids. All other races (ecemptions
negotiable) are the result of theocratic attempts to “improve” existing
races and will have to live with corresponding prejudice, but can
overcome it. Dragonborn and Tieflings constitute the largest populations
of those “Godlings” in the Broken Lands.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Should you have an awesome concept that clashes with those
boundaries, speak up, at this time everything is negotiable.</p>
<p>(From where I’m standing, you don’t need to coordinate for a
“balanced” party. If we wind up with an all-Rogue or all-Cleric party,
we’ll find ways to make it work.)</p>

<p>I get positive feedback quite quickly, so I know I can move on - even
a</p>

<p>Yay, City of Stairs!</p>

<p>from one of my players. Fortunately, I’m only stealing the setting,
not the story, so I don’t mind and am actually happy that my rambling

<div id="unnecessary-step-6---i-need-want-a-world-map"
class="section level2">
<h2>Unnecessary Step 6 - I <del>need</del> want a world map</h2>
<p>I know I don’t <em>need</em> much of a map - a quick sketch of the
immediate surroundings would do - but I’d stumbled across the amazing <a
href="https://azgaar.github.io/Fantasy-Map-Generator/">Azgaar’s Fantasy
Map Generator</a> and wanted to give it a whirl. I mean, how hard can it
be?</p>
<p>Well, harder than I thought (I should have known), but still fairly
easy overall.</p>
<p>(This is not a complete waste of time, though. Auto-generated content
is not always immediately usable by itself, but it’s great fuel for
creativity.)</p>
<p>After familiarizing myself and fiddling a bit with the menus, I
vaguely remember that, in the books, the leading state of the rebellious
alliance was situated on a peninsula, which gives me a starting point -
I switch the <em>heightmap</em> option to “peninsula” and generate a few
maps until I find one where the overall layout looks of the nations
looks plausible.</p>
<p>Then I discover the “Cultures” layer, which defines the naming of
places and is great - but it triggers me to think about what the
different cultures should “feel” like.</p>
<p>Before doing that, I regenerate the culture layer, until one culture
massively dominates most of the continental regions, this’ll be the
imperial culture (which spread all over the place).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/safia_cultures.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Culture Map</p>
</div>
<p>I like the idea of the old Empire being roman-themed, because that
felt fitting to me in Skyrim, so I lock that in as their namespace.</p>
<p>The algorithm placed a dash of a people with a Finnic namebase up
north, who were part of the empire, that’s interesting. Did they somehow
preserve a cultural identity? If so, how? Or did just their naming
traditions endure? Either way, I’m keeping them.</p>
<p>Then I just slot in stuff that seems fun and plausible. A Germanic
namebase for the coastal region where a good chunk of the former vassal
states are situated (including the aforementioned peninsula) and a greek
one for a large southern island, that should do it - no need to go
overboard.</p>
<p>Lastly, I regenerate nations (“states”), provinces, rivers and cities
(“burgs”) again to apply the new namespaces, then do it over a few times
until it looks right.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/safia_nations.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Nation Map</p>
</div>
<p>Somehow, the algorithm tends to split the region I consider the
Empire’s heartlands into two states (a very large and a large one),
which frustrates me a bit, until I decide to embrace it.</p>
<p>Maybe part of the empire seceded during the rebellion, switching
sides to ensure their survival? At this point, their gods would already
have fallen and the Alliance would be distrustful of their loyalty, but
the remains of their government would be able to stay in power, a thing
that governments seem to prefer doing. So let’s consider that canon for
now.</p>
<p>Done.</p>
<p>The tool also has a bunch of stuff about diplomatic relationships,
where I can define what state A thinks about state B, about where which
military units are stationed, historical wars and much more, but I leave
all of that alone.</p>
<p>I <em>do</em> use it as an opportunity to think about the current
relations of the Alliance members, though.</p>
<p>Making them all a big, happy family would be a bit… <em>Star
Trek</em>, so I insert some drama - <em>this</em> smallish country over
here is actually a freshly seceded province of <em>that</em> state and
<em>those</em> neighbours helped them along. <em>These</em> people here
and <em>those</em> over there both want to colonize (and maybe annex)
that island down <em>here</em>, which the algorithm decreed to be
virtually unpopulated, for it’s resources - stuff like that.</p>
<p>I don’t bother writing any of this down, having it sloshing around in
the back of my head will be enough until i need it to draw inspiration
from.</p>
<p>The last step is to fiddle a bit with colours and fonts until the map
looks <em>cool</em>:</p>

<h2>No More Steps - we’re done with the setting</h2>
<p>For now, at least. I’m confident I’ve got enough input swirling
around in my mind that I can present the world as a living, breathing
place, and improvise unplanned details as needed.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="writing-the-first-adventure" class="section level1">
<h1>Writing the First Adventure</h1>
<p>So… here we go. Everything so far pays into the campaign overall, but
this is what we actually <em>need</em> to get started.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="step-1---getting-a-rough-outline" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 1 - Getting a Rough Outline</h2>
<p>This is a part that, even if I’d tried to avoid it (I didn’t), would
have come up during my period of “mulling over” the campaign before
actually sitting down and writing anything.</p>
<p>What do we actually want?</p>
<ul>
<li>Since our players know virtually nothing yet about the local events,
locations etc. (as of now, neither do we) or even about the motivations
of the other characters, it’d be difficult for them to define an
opportunity to pursue on their own - so this’ll be a job given to them
by an NPC</li>
<li>A thing that’s important to their characters, but, as of yet, poorly
defined, is The Guild, so lets make it be relevant to the job</li>
</ul>
<p>From here, an obvious idea emerges - we, so far, know of only one
occasion where The Guild takes direct action: When one of their members
goes against The Code.</p>
<p>We have not yet defined the The Code yet, so, at least viewed from a
distance, the deed needs to be rather unambiguously bad. Let’s say a
member of The Guild has established themselves as a local warlord and
taken up banditry, taking people’s stuff by force etc.</p>
<p>I’m imagining guild member that came to the region from outside,
maybe originating from somewhere in the Alliance, and going… bad,
somehow.</p>
<p>Let’s call them… Johann Brahm. (During the first session, my players
will be quick to point out that my subconscious probably meant <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Brahms">Johannes
Brahms</a>, but hey, what’s done is done.) Being a bandit chief /
warlord now, he likes to call himself “the Iron Johan”.</p>
<p>I don’t see such a person waking up one morning and deciding to take
over all the small bandit groups that undoubtedly already exist in the
area - no, something much more plausible (to me) would be if he’d, for
example, aligned himself with a part of the population that is usually
destitute and whose most common reliable skill is violence - and then,
things escalated somehow to a point where he took off with a bunch of
them to “find a better life” or something, and ultimately, it all ended
in banditry.</p>
<p>Such a group is easy to come up with - there <em>was</em> a war,
after all. Let’s say that there was am imperial army hailing from
another province in the region. They lost their battles and, when the
war ended, many did not find their way home (or their home was lost to
either the ravages of war or the slight… <em>reorganisation</em> of maps
that followed The Fall).</p>
<p>Now there’s a lot of veterans in the area, many of them maimed, with
no familiar ties to the local population, that are desperately trying to
stay afloat in harsh times. The locals generally don’t like them very
much (this is the army that failed to protect them, now they’re an
economical burden and also, they’re basically foreigners), so it’s easy
to imagine how the most desperate of them might be willing to take to
banditry.</p>
<p>I’m not thinking about a <em>solution</em> to the problem I’ve
created, that’s my players’ job.</p>
<p><strong>Prep Time for this section:</strong> Beyond any musing had
during the 2 days of “mulling things over a bit”, maybe twenty
minutes.</p>

<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="step-2---what-do-we-actually-need" class="section level2">
<h2>Step 2 - What Do we actually need?</h2>
<p>The first session will include some stuff that’s not really
gameplay:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describing the setting in broad strokes and answering questions, so
the players will have a rough idea of what their PCs know.</li>
<li>Going over character choices (<strong>this should usually be done
separately</strong>, but I know my players very well.)</li>
<li>Giving them an intro of where they are and and what their initial
task is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once that’s done, I’ll have them arrive in the starting town. Knowing
them, their first orders of business will probably look something like
this:</p>
<ul>
<li>verify some stuff about their understanding of the town with me</li>
<li>find a place to sleep</li>
<li>do some legwork and try to unearth some details about the Iron Johan
<ul>
<li>they’ll definitely try to talk to whoever is in charge here</li>
<li>they’ll try to get their hands on a map</li>
</ul></li>
<li>formulate a basic plan for their next steps
<ul>
<li>hire a guide, if necessary</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>That’ll be probably sufficient for the first session, if they swerve
wildly off-course, I’ll just have to improvise.</p>
<p><strong>Prep Time for this section:</strong> None, like I’ve said, I
know my players very well so the above is immediately obvious to me.</p>

twenty minutes.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="step-3---putting-the-adventure-on-the-map"
class="section level2">
<h2>Step 3 - Putting the adventure on the map</h2>
<p>First order of business is to nail down a starting town somewhere in
the Broken Lands - so I switch on the biomes view on my
<em>Azgaar’s</em> world map, find the colour that seems to roughly
correlate to a central European environment (which is where I want to
start), zoom in and scroll around a bit.</p>
<p>Ultimately I find a nice town at the edge of my preferred biome,
close to the open grassland, at the end of a trade route that seems like
what I need. The algorithm named it <em>Renemi</em>, which’ll do.</p>
<p><em>Azgaar’s Fantasy Map Generator</em> is linked with
<em>another</em> great map generator used for city maps, <a
href="https://watabou.github.io/city-generator/?size=15&amp;seed=1027015709&amp;greens=0&amp;farms=1&amp;citadel=1&amp;urban_castle=0&amp;plaza=1&amp;temple=0&amp;walls=1&amp;shantytown=1&amp;coast=0&amp;river=1&amp;gates=-1">Watabou’s
Medieval City Generator</a> and has already linked a city map for us. I
fiddle with the generator’s settings a bit and refresh the map until I’m
happy, then change the link to my new version. This’ll be helpful for
the first session, but it’s only a bonus and not crucial.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="images/renemi.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Renemi</p>
</div>
<p>When thinking about the regional map (which is the only map I
<em>actually</em> need), I completely fail to realize that watabou has
great generators for those as well (I’ll learn about that later), so I
just take out a sheet of blank paper and a pen.</p>
<p>Looking at the zoomed-in world map, I put in Renemi on the eastern
side, the trade route terminating there (so - a road) leading off the
map and a meandering, line where the grasslands seem to begin -
everything below that line is forests, meadows etc.</p>
<p>Now let’s fill that with a bit of stuff.</p>
<p>Obviously, the party will want to know where the Iron Johann’s raids
are occurring.</p>
<p>Logistically, they’ll need to happen some place where there’s stuff
worth taking. I know that there’s a larger city, Castrum (the province’s
capital) further off my map to the northwest, but, for some reason, the
world map algorithm put no direct trade route leading there - so I’m
inventing one, heading north into the plains and then turning
northwest.</p>
<p>I add a smaller city in the plains to that route, imagining it to
trade in lots of grassland goods (wool, mammoth tusks and whatnot) and
add a river cutting through the map from south to north to supply it
with water. Reserving the roman naming scheme for places of imperial
importance, I name the river Immel and the town Immelgard.</p>
<p>Also, two villages - Isenfall directly on the river, Bluewater at the
like-named lake, who’s outflow connects to the Immel. The latter will be
the place where Johann Brahm was gainfully employed before things went
south, mostly because i need to put that pin <em>somewhere</em>, after
all.</p>
<p>There’s still a bit too many empty spaces on the map, so I add a bog
somewhere in the vicinity of the river and a mysterious-yet-dangerous
place of interest, a devastated forest region of the
no-one-who-went-there-came-back category I’m calling Worldsend, at the
very west.</p>
<p>That’ll do - no need in overdoing it, just enough to make the map not
seem empty and seed some stuff for the future.</p>
<p>The resulting map looks like the scribbles of a preschooler, but my
players are used to that kind of stuff.</p>

<h2>Step 4 - Finishing Touches</h2>
<p>There’s a few more details I’d like to add, just to have them
handy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="digital-toolbelt" class="section level3">
<h3>Digital Toolbelt</h3>
<p>First, there’s some tools I’d like to have within easy reach:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/osr/comments/omtd4g/4_season_weather_table_hex_easy_and_logical/">Weather
Hexflower</a> - I like introducing <em>some</em> unexpected elements
into my stories, both as creativity seeds and as a reminder to my
players that the world doesn’t care about their plans and this’ll do
nicely.</li>
<li>A <a
href="https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com/roman_names.php">Random Name
Generator</a>, never leave home without it.</li>
<li>An <a href="https://ironsworn.glitch.me/">Irosnworn Oracle
Website</a> - an awesome tool for on-the-spot creativity prompts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Prep Time for this section:</strong> Twenty minutes, most of
it spent finding a nice Hexflower, trying to print it, finding out that
my printer is possessed by the printer devil and deciding to make do
without a printed version.</p>
<p><strong>Total Prep Time before next session:</strong> Six hours,
forty minutes.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="optional-sidekick" class="section level3">
<h3>Optional Sidekick</h3>
<p>My party’s current PCs have no wilderness survival skill whatsoever.
While this tells me that I shouldn’t go overboard with wilderness
content, travel <em>should</em> be perilous.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I know that <em>they</em> know this. I also know that,
unless one of them shows up with a freshly generated wilderness
specialist, they’ll try to hire a local one.</p>
<p>So let’s sketch one out, just in case. And make them at least
<em>somewhat</em> combat capable - they’ll probably accompany the group
for a while and should survive a standard encounter.</p>
<p>I don’t like to use a Ranger, because I don’t want the Sidekick to
have cool spells. I don’t want to use a Rogue, because Rogues can be
fairly strong before level 5 and we already have a Rogue.</p>
<p>I’ve got a ranged Fighter concept lying around, a Goblin Battlemaster
Archer based on using ranged maneuvers from hiding. Let’s remove the
Battlemaster stuff but keep the racial <em>Cunning Action</em>, make
them a level lower than the party and refocus the skills on Survival,
Nature and Medicine.</p>
<p>I imagine him as an old-ish unkempt Goblin drunk named Truush, who’s
only in it for the booze money, won’t risk his hide for the party, hides
throughout combat (although may occasionally shoot his shortbow), but is
knowledgeable about the area, the main roads, the animals, common
monsters and whatnot and, above all, affordable with a reputation for
being somewhat reliable.</p>
<p>If a player shows up with those skills covered, but they’ll still try
to get some expert advice on the area, Truush will be willing to give
them some tips, but unwilling to accompany them on their dangerous
antics.</p>
<p><strong>Prep Time for this section:</strong> Twenty minutes, most of
it fiddling with the “full PC” version of Truush for funsies, before
cutting off all the bells and whistles anyway.</p>

so I’m not too worried about it.)</p>
<p>There’s a ton of stuff I could have prepped. Some of this are
elements I <em>know</em> I can come up with on the fly (i.e. NPCs). Some
of it I just don’t deem likely to come up, so I’m loathe to invest prep

<h2>House Rule Discussion</h2>
<p>I’ve got a list of house rules that have either already been
established at our table or that I’d like to introduce for this
campaign, so it’s time to discuss them:</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="longer-rest-times" class="section level3">
<h3>Longer Rest Times</h3>
<p>5e is balanced for 4+ (actually 6-8, I believe) encounters and ~2
Short Rests per Long Rests - use less, and a lot of stuff falls out of
whack.</p>
<p>Knowing my playstyle, I tend to do one, maybe two resource-draining
encounters per adventuring day.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I decree that a Short Rest is a night’s sleep and
a Long Rest is 24h of downtime (usable for downtime activities).</p>
<p>Overall, since this doesn’t alter the intended encounter density of
the game, it causes some raised eyebrows, but goes through without much
discussion.</p>
<p><br></p>
</div>
<div id="narrative-group-initiative" class="section level3">
<h3>Narrative Group Initiative</h3>
<p>We’ve already used Group Initiative before, to smooth things
over.</p>
<p>All I do is add a slight twist:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is clear from the narrative, which group should go first
(i.e. the party stumbling, weapons drawn, into the Guard’s break room),
the narrative decides which group goes first.</li>
<li>Otherwise, the member with the highest average initiative of each
group rolls initiative for the whole group. If any group member has
advantage on initiative rolls, they get to roll their own initiative
once, too - if they can beat the first roll, their roll is used
instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Within their initiative, group members can go in any order. Issues
concerning the duration of “until the beginning/end of your next turn”
effects will be dealt with on an ad-hoc basis.</p>

<h3>Power Attacks</h3>
<p>(This is stolen from <a

<p>Any PC can apply “-5 to attack, +10 to damage” to any attack made
with the <em>Attack Action</em>.</p>

Master</em> / <em>Crossbow Expert</em>.)</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Rachel can’t make it today, so there’s just three players at the
table.</p>
<p>We review characters (all but Brice are the already-known PCs, scaled
down to level three) and go over the setting a bit.</p>
<p>Besides some minor clarification stuff, Brian asks why only the more
exotic races are the result of divine meddling - why not apply this to
all non-human races? It’d explain a lot of headscratchers (i.e. how are
Humans and Elves related? They can interbreed, after all…) and I like
it, so it’s canon now.</p>
<p>Other than that, we nail down the in-world interpretation of
everyone’s background (Scorch is a mercenary Guild veteran, Winston
&amp; Payne are members of different noble houses and have joined the
Guild recently; Everyone hails from the Broken Lands) and I give them
the rundown on the quest:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Guild has approached them, either via another member or via mail
about unverified reports of a member going Rogue somewhere in the
Castrix Province (name provided by Azgaar’s Map Algorithm),
<em>probably</em> somewhere around Renemi.</li>
<li>Their job is to travel to Renemi and find out what exactly happened.
If they can solve the problem themselves, there’s a cash bonus, but when
in doubt, they’re supposed to report back.</li>
<li>Other Guild members are being sent to other regions within the
province.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that (and any questions about it) done, we jump into them
arriving in the city.</p>

<p>The very first thing my players do blindsides me: They worry about
secrecy. If the Iron Johan is (potentially) operating somewhere in the
region, they consider it extremely likely that he’ll have spies in the
city - after all, he’ll need to learn about any valuable transports
happening. Also, he should <em>know</em> that The Guild will send
someone after him.</p>
<p>I just nod and make “that sounds plausible” noises, while quietly
deciding that such spies do indeed exist, are difficult but not
impossible to find and that, if the group takes too long, Johan will be
warned about them. However, due to the measures they’ve employed, his
intel will be inaccurate.</p>
<p>The next thing Sven (Scorch) asks about is also one I did not prep
for: Does the Guild maintain Guild Houses in the cities it’s operating
in?</p>
<p>While this doesn’t fit with how I imagine the Guild operating (they
don’t have the infrastructure nor manpower to do that), the idea of a
gathering place for Guild members in the region seems plausible, so I
decide that The Guild usually finds an inn with an agreeable, reliable
owner and turns it into a semi-official contact place: If there’s Guild
Members in the city, they tend to swing by, leave and get messages as
well as a nice discount and helpful rumors to boot. Let’s call their
chosen inn in Renemi the <em>White Tusk</em>.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the session mostly meanders between the boundaries I’d
suspected during prep - they visit the local governor
(Mr. let-me-check-my-name-generator - a good opportunity to hand them my
map), try to get an understanding of what kind of town this is and see
if they can verify the reports they get from officials by independent
means - talking to some of the veterans, trying to discreetly establish
contact with the (now illegal) remnants of the Imperial cults that are
bound to still exist somewhere and pour over the map, trying to decide
where to go first.</p>
<p>Not just one, but two of them inquire about hiring a reliable
wilderness guide, so I direct them to an improvised semi-legal liquor
den called the <em>Bucket</em>, where they manage to recruit the
half-drunk grumpy Truush.</p>
<p>Overall, the (improvised) findings that might be relevant for the
future are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Iron Johan raided two supply/relief convois shortly behind
Immelgard, one and three months ago (for the record, it’s spring now).
To up the ante a bit, one of those convoys was carrying a cask of
gunpowder.</li>
<li>He’s a boastful character, always trying to appear of larger station
than he actually is - spending generously, trying to mingle with
nobility etc.</li>
<li>His last legitimate, Guild-powered job was a long-time employment as
an advisor in Bluewater (on the other side of the map)</li>
<li>Most of the veterans don’t think much of their
bethren-turned-bandits. They were soldiers tasked with
<em>protecting</em> the civilian (imperial) populace, robbing them
instead is dishonorable. Nevertheless, they’re hesitant to be truly
helpful, those <em>are</em> their former comrades, after all</li>
<li>The veterans come from a unit commonly just called the “4th
Regiment” and were a unit of mostly Warg Handlers / Skirmishers.</li>
<li>Many of the surviving Wargs have escaped to the wilderness and are a
major danger on the road</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, it was a rather routined start (my players have done things
like this a hundred times), but it served well in allowing them to find
their feet and get an idea of both the adventure and the setting. The
players definitely liked it and are looking forward to go on.</p>

<h2>Oopsies</h2>
<p>Viewing this from a few weeks further down the road, I probably
<em>should</em> have started the campaign with a strong scene - maybe a
fight on the road. Nevertheless, it worked out well and can’t be
changed.</p>
<p>Also, right during the session, I see that Renemi lacks easy access
to fresh water. Oops. Fortunately, none of my players bring this up, so
I’ll have time to fix that.</p>
<p>I brought a Weather Hex Flower with the intention of rolling on it,
but completely forgot. No biggie, I’ll try to remember next time - if I
find that I consistently forget about it, I’ll ditch it.</p>
