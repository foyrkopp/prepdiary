## What' This?

Just a bit of follow-along Prep for a Dungeons and Dragons game I'm running.

The idea is to give other DMs an over-the-shoulder view how others are prepping their games.


## Getting Started

First time readers should probably start at [The Beginning](./docs/Prep00_Starting_Out.html). Otherwise, check out the "entries" menu at thet top.
